  <h2>A Short But Powerful Money Hypnosis:</h2>
  <p><i><strong>"Thinking about the present moment in any way that brings you a sense of comfort in financial success, begin to notice everything else that increases this feeling for you until you are one with having great financial abundance. Now, relaxing into this further, notice how much more like yourself you feel wealthy, but noticing this with your heart."</strong></i></p>
    <h2>What is this saying:</h2>
  <p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>In this mindfulness exercise is aimed at cultivating a sense of comfort and abundance in your financial success. It encourages focusing on the present moment and identifying anything that brings a feeling of financial security or prosperity. By paying attention to these positive aspects, the aim is to align yourself more closely with the concept of having great financial abundance. You are then guided to relax further into this mindset, observing how it makes you feel, emphasizing the importance of connecting with this feeling on an emotional level, using the heart as a guide.</p>

    <p>How does it do this?</p>

<p><strong>Setting the Stage:</strong> The passage starts by encouraging you to think about the present moment in ways that bring you comfort regarding your financial success. This sets the tone for the exercise, focusing on the current state of abundance rather than scarcity.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding Awareness:</strong> Next, you are prompted to notice anything else that contributes to this feeling of comfort and financial success. This step helps you recognize the abundance already present in your life, reinforcing positive thoughts and beliefs about your finances.</p>
<p><strong>Deepening the Connection:</strong> As you immerse yourself in these feelings of abundance, the passage encourages you to relax further into this mindset. This step allows you to connect with these positive emotions on a deeper level, enhancing your sense of wealth and abundance.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Integration:</strong> Finally, the passage emphasizes the importance of noticing these feelings of abundance with your heart, rather than just your mind. This emotional connection solidifies the sense of wealth and abundance, making it feel more authentic and aligned with your true desires.</p>



  <p>Overall, the passage guides you through a series of steps designed to shift your mindset towards abundance and financial success, using mindfulness and emotional awareness to manifest greater wealth in your life.</p>
