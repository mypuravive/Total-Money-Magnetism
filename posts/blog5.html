  <h2>A Short But Powerful Money Hypnosis:</h2>
  <p><i><strong>"Notice yourself beginning to relax in any way that makes you aware of feeling financially abundant, but only until this feeling becomes a natural bond you share with you heart. And as you allow your subconscious mind to become one with this feeling, without distractions, you may now notice this feeling become a natural part of who you are."</strong></i></p>
    <h2>What is this saying:</h2>
  <p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>This passage is intended to encourage you to become aware of moments when you feel or have felt relaxed and financially abundant. It suggests that as you cultivate this feeling, it should gradually become a natural part of you. By allowing your subconscious mind to embrace this feeling without distractions, it can integrate into your being, enhancing your sense of financial abundance.</p>
      <p>It does this through:</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Mindfulness:</strong> It encourages you to notice moments when you feel relaxed and financially abundant. By paying attention to these moments, you become more aware of the positive feelings associated with financial abundance.
     </p>

<p><strong>Subconscious Programming:</strong> By repeatedly focusing on and acknowledging these feelings of abundance, you're effectively programming your subconscious mind. This repetition helps reinforce the belief that you are financially abundant, which can influence your thoughts, behaviors, and ultimately, your reality.</p>

<p><strong>Natural Integration:</strong> Over time, as you continue to cultivate this feeling of abundance and allow it to permeate your subconscious without distractions, it becomes ingrained in your mindset. Eventually, the feeling of financial abundance becomes a natural part of who you are, influencing your perceptions and actions in alignment with abundance.</p>

<p>In essence, by consistently reinforcing positive feelings of financial abundance and allowing them to sink into your subconscious mind, you gradually shift your mindset and perception to one of abundance, which can attract more abundance into your life.</p>
